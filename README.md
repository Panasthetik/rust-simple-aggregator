# rust-simple-aggregator
Aggregates data from Supabase, MongoDB and NEAR Protocol and prints to the terminal.

This is the first draft/demo version, without unit tests.

UPDATE 3/2/2023: Changed to a "paragraph" to format the refined JSON output from all three sources, instead of a bulk data dump.

Instructions are forthcoming in early 2023.
